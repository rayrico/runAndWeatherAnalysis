# runAndWeatherAnalysis

## Project Overview
This project looks through my Strava running data as well as what the weather was during each run. I also utilize multiple linear regression analysis.

## Datasets
I used two datasets. The first was my Strava activities which I exported. Some features originally included were Activity Date, Elapsed Time, Distance, Elevation Gain, Elevation Loss, and Average Heart Rate. My second was from Open-Meteo Free Open Source API which contains weather components such as temperature (and apparent temperature), precipitaion_sum, snowfall_sum, and relative humidity.
